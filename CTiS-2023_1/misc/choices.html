<h1>Choices: AI's use in Space Exploration</h1>

	<p align="justify">In the realm of space exploration, AI carries profound potential. The expanding capabilities of AI can revolutionize 
		our understanding of the universe. From enhancing efficiency and safety to offering economic opportunities, AI stands to be an essential 
		tool in our ongoing exploration of the cosmos.</p>
	<p align="justify">However, with great potential come great challenges. AI systems will need to be able to adapt to novel situations and withstand severe 
		conditions of alien terrain, and latency issues might present considerable obstacles to our reliance on these systems. We also must take into account 
		the risks of autonomous technology falling into the wrong hands and being utilized for harmful purposes.</p>
	<p align="justify">Yet, despite these challenges, AI remains a vital resource in our quest to expand our knowledge of the universe. The risks associated with its
		usage in space exploration are less than in other domains due to the natural barriers of space, which act as a shield against many potential threats. 
		The vastness of space also provides an ideal testing ground for the capabilities of AI, allowing us to exploit its full potential in ways we can't on Earth.</p>
