		<td> <em>This topic explores the potential applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the realm of space and planetary exploration.
			As it is now known, AI has begun revolutionizing the world at an extraordinary rate, it has become a crucial tool for scientists to gather and examine complex data, and 
			this data led to ground-breaking discoveries, especially in the field of astronomy. Ai has proven its worth by continuously being instrumental in the pursuit of knowledge, 
			it has helped scientists make significant steps in numerous fields of learning. Our team was determined to conduct extensive research on the possible opportunities and risks 
			associated with AIâ€™s role in planetary exploration. The main focus is on how AI can aid us, mainly rovers, in exploring all types of alien terrain, both positively and negatively. 
			Another objective of ours is to inform people about the significant contributions AI has made in discovering various planetary bodies in our universe, and its potential to achieve even 
			greater advancements in the field of astronomy. This topic also makes sure to highlight the significance and importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in pursuit of gaining the necessary
			knowledge in order to advance our understanding of the universe and how different planetary bodies work.</em></td>
