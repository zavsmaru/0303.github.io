<h3><p>Ethical Reflection: Marius</p></h3> 
<p align="justify">As time moves forward, the influence of Artificial Intelligence will continue to grow, 
	and with growth, a vast amount of new knowledge will be born and give us new perspectives on what would be
	possible in our lifetime. These influences will continue improving and will continue to help our community to 
	grow with newly gained knowledge.</p>
<p align="justify">However, multiple ethical aspects need to be kept in mind when working with AI. These aspects are needed 
	to keep AI from being too irrational and help the people who work with it gather appropriate data. An example would be 
	making sure that AI systems are built free from biases and are fair in giving outcomes when asked. This aspect will
	affect the data gathered from space exploration missions and will hinder the possible advancement of future space missions.</p>
<p align="justify">Since AI has now become more autonomous, another ethical-related challenge that might affect is the extent of human 
	involvement when it comes to AI-driven missions. It is important to keep a healthy amount of balance between autonomous decision-making
	and ethical decision-making, and the ability to address unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, it is important to ensure that the AI system being used provides fairness and is needed to have some sort of 
	human influence in case of making comments which disregard ethical views. It is done to ensure that the data we gather is viable to be
	used in the following space missions.</p>
