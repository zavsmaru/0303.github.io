<h3><p>Ethical Reflection: Marius</p></h3> 
<p align="justify">As we move forward in time, the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will continue to grow, and with that
	growth a vast amount of new knowledge will be born and give us new perspectives on what would be possible in our lifetime. 
	These influences will continue improving and will continue to help our community grow with the newly gained knowledge.</p>
<p align="justify">However, there are multiple ethical-related problems that need to be addressed when working with AI systems. 
	These problems are important to keep in track as it can cause hinders in research and discoveries. An example that comes to mind 
	would be ensuring that AIs are built free of bias and are able to provide the users with fair and honest data. If this problem is overlooked,
	it may cause all types of difficulties not only for present missions but also for future ones if not properly settled with.</p>
<p align="justify">Since AI has now become more independent, another ethical-related challenge that might affect is the extent of human involvement
	when it comes to missions involving AI. It is important to keep a healthy amount of balance between autonomous decision-making and ethical 
	decision-making, and the ability to tackle unexpected circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, it is important to ensure that the AI system being used provides fairness and is needed to have some sort of human 
	influence in case of making comments which disregard ethical views. It is done to ensure that the data we gather is viable to be used in 
	future space/planetary missions.</p>

<h3><p>Ethical Reflection: Jesper</p></h3> 
<p align="justify">AI is a very powerful technology still in its infancy. There is much current debate over what regulations and considerations its developers 
	should be held to. What data AI models are trained on is one of the most important for various reasons.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is near impossible to pinpoint individual copyright infringements from an AI generation, and many models trawl through thousands of 
	pages of web content with blatant disregard for the work of creators.</p>
<p align="justify">Training data, even if ethically obtained can also be rife with errors and bias, and bad input leads to bad output. One of the most 
	controversial aspects of current AI technology is black box vs white box models; as models are fed more and more data and make greater and more complex inferences 
	from them, it grows harder and harder for its operators to understand them, thus a black box model is one whoâ€™s process is completely illegible to humans. </p>
<p align="justify">There has been much push to require human-readable white box models, as there are fears that a model we do not understand will perform in unpredictable 
	ways and could act against human interests.</p>
<p align="justify">No matter how AI is implemented in the future, it is of the utmost importance to address these fundamental issues now before they become impossible to regulate.</p>

<h3><p>Ethical Reflection: Yu</p></h3> 
<p align="justify">The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in space exploration presents an array of ethical quandaries spanning from design 
	accountability to potential repercussions on Earth and beyond.A key issue is determining culpability in the event of unintended harm caused by 
	AI in space, such as ecological contamination or loss of crucial scientific data.With no immediate human control, this extends beyond Earth-bound
	ethical dilemmas, necessitating a reevaluation of responsibility concepts.</p>
<p align="justify">Transparency in the development and deployment of AI systems is equally vital. It's crucial to ensure that AI algorithms are auditable and 
	transparent for safety,fairness, and regulatory compliance. Explainability not only enhances trust in these technologies but also bolsters their resilience
	to unforeseen space challenges.</p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, the dual-use potential of AI is a significant concern. Despite the advantages AI advancements could provide for space exploration,
	the risk of misuse,such as in warfare, is also evident. Hence, the importance of establishing international regulations to prevent AI misuse in harmful 
	activities cannot be overstated.Planetary protection is another ethical aspect to consider. As we dispatch more AI-enabled rovers and probes to other planets, safeguards must
	be implemented to prevent inadvertent harm to potential extraterrestrial life or ecosystems.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, the ethical implications of space exploration commercialization and mining by private firms need to be considered. Although this opens
	up economic opportunities, it could also lead to a new form of resource exploitation. Ethical guidelines should be established to ensure equitable and 
	sustainable practices in space exploration and resource extraction.</p>
