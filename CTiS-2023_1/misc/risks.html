<h1> Risks</h1>
<p align="justify"> <b>There are several risks associated with heavier reliance on AI technology for use in planetary exploration including:</b></p>

</ul><p align="justify"> <b>Adaptability to unknown scenarios:</b></p>
	<p align="justify"> The success of an AI system depends greatly on having sufficient training data. Given that this system will be used to analyze information on an alien planet,
		providing useful training data may prove difficult, as may analysis of the alien terrain.</p>
	
	<br><p align="justify"> <b>Latency issues:</b></p>	
	<p align="justify"> Mars is one of the closest planets the AI system will be used on, but the average latency between Earth and Mars is 20 minutes. This means that even with humans
		closely monitoring the system, the fastest reaction time we could have would be 40 minutes, which leaves a fully autonomous system a lot of time to make a mistake.
		This is a problem which is further compounded the greater the distance from Earth the system is used. <p>
	
	<br><p align="justify"> <b>Fully autonomous machine development: </b></p>
	<p align="justify"> The Russo-Ukrainian War has been raging for over a year, causing over 60,000 deaths and great destruction. A distinguishing feature of the war has been the
		unparalleled use of drone warfare. Some of these drones are little more than flying IEDs, but others are so sophisticated they are able to identify and destroy targets
		without any human operator to pull its trigger. As AI systems for autonomous machines like our planetary explorers are further researched, developed and made accessible, 
		so too may these autonomous drones, becoming even more powerful and deadly. </p>
	
	<br><p align="justify"> <b>Impossible repairs: </b></p>
	<p align="justify">Due to the massive costs of returning and fixing unmanned machines in space, there can be no room for error when building the robots and sending them to their 
		host planets. An oversight in how a rover might operate in space could cost investors billions; a clear dissuasion to companies considering the production of this technology.</p>
