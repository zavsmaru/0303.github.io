	<h2><b>The Role of AI IN PLANETARY EXPLORATION </b></h2>
		<p align="justify"> AI has remained significant over time and is known to have improved drastically. It is known to have helped humans
			in numerous ways across various fields from astronomy and astrophysics to archaeology and anthropology. It has proven its worth numerous 
			times and it only continues to grow more efficiently with the passing of time. It is known to have the potential to revolutionize various
			aspects of space exploration as well.</p>
		<p align="justify">Our team decided to focus on the topic of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help us humans in exploring space, specifically, its role in planetary 
			exploration. AI has mainly helped in the fields of astronomy by being able to discover and classify astronomical objects found in our universe, but as time passed 
			it is now known to be used on rovers which gives them the ability to make decisions autonomously during exploration in an alien terrain. These autonomous rovers are 
			therefore able to gather efficient and gather necessary information and data for the scientists on our planet to study and learn new things about. AI will continue to 
			play a significant role when it comes to space/planetary exploration as it will be necessary to push the boundaries of exploration and gain new scientific understandings,
			and it will help in paving the way for future discoveries. </p>
