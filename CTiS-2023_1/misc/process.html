</ul><p align="justify">Our group was able to fully maximize our collaboration and productivity by making use of platforms throughout the process of making the project. 
	On our first meeting, we discussed possible ways to communicate effectively, and ultimately, we ended up using the Discord group chat function as our 
	main way of communication, this app allowed us to stay connected and updated especially during the times when we werenâ€™t together. </p>
	
	<p align="justify">During both physical and virtual meetings, we were able to assign specific roles to each member of the group and then we were able to focus on our research.
		To document our progress with the project, we made use of the Google Docs platform, using this app we were able to compile and share our research.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">After gathering the necessary research materials, we progressed toward making our presentations and made use of the comments given to us by the Teaching Assistant.
		Using those comments, we kept them in mind and gradually progressed toward the final step of the project which was making the website. Our team used GitHub as our main way of 
		creating a website, we established a repository to store the provided essential files to develop a website. This platform also provided our team with the tracking of the changes 
		done in the file.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">Both Discord and Google Docs proved to have played significant roles in the enhancement of our project. Using these platforms, we were able to seek inputs and opinions from one another,
		which resulted in positive outcomes. Throughout the project, we continued to maintain discussions, updates, and bug reports regarding our website.</p>
	
	<p align="justify">By properly utilizing these platforms, we significantly enhanced the outcome of this project. These applications provided our team with continuous communication, allowed us to stay informed 
		about the progress of each member, and provided us with a way to communicate whenever we needed assistance. With the use of these platforms and effective communication, 
		we were able to achieve a successful outcome for our project.</p>
